Changes:

Charlie:
[x] two screens (emteq screen and unity screen)
[ ]	Height / Platform Issues:
	[ ] beach feels scary (height problem, platform solution)
	[ ] hight differences between scenes problem
	[ ] in some scenes the stimuli feel too big (e.g. toilet role, door, toilet, bin) - feel small in a giant room)
[ ] Tutorial:
	[ ] AV values for practice scences are not correct
	[ ] start instructions (remind about right to withdraw when too upsetting)
	[ ] send instruction (the scriptable obejcts for the user) list as word documents and screenshots to all of us. 
[ ] Experiment:
	[ ] Add skip / override for Emteq sensor UI
	[ ] perspective changing between blocks not trials
	[ ] beach scenes after every trial (if possible)
	[ ] transition needs to be whole screen, square shaped and trigger at the end of the square time (start of new scene)
	[ ] triggers before every event (trial based; think with Ellen about triggernames)
	[ ] add emteq triggers and LSL
	[ ] data files for differnt states (room rotations, ... ) - we need to do have this post-processing
	[x] blur out person in office
