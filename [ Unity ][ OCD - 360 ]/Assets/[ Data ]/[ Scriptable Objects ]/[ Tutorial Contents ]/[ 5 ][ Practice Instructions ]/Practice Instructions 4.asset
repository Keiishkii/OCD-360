  content: "Each scene will be presented for 30 seconds. \n\nWe therefore encourage
    you to continuously and dynamically change your rating as your feelings about
    the scene change and develop.\r\n\r\nFor example, you may feel yourself becoming
    more relaxed as you continue to visually explore and imagine being within this
    scene. \n\nTherefore, move your thumb to the target location on the touchpad
    to signal a reduction in arousal.\r"
