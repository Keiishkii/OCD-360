  content: "Occasionally the second viewpoint may elicit very similar feelings of
    arousal and valence to the first viewpoint. \r\n\r\nIn these instances, we ask
    that you continue to keep your thumb in contact with the touchpad at the chosen
    location to maintain a continuous rating score between the scenes. \r\n\r\nThe
    touchpad is highly sensitive and even the slightest change in thumb position
    will be recorded and will be of interest to us when we come to analyse the data.\r"
